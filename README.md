A simple way to password protect files in PC using AES128 algorithm.

step 1): download the files and unzip it.

step 2): Compile the EncryptDecryptFiles.cpp file using C++ compiler / VS Code

step 3): before running the EncryptDecryptFiles.exe file that you get after compiling, first copy/move the file you want to encrypt into the folder in which the .exe file is present.

step 4): run the .exe file and enter the details. When asked for filename, enter the exact filename of the file along with the extension. Eg: image.jpg

step 5): the encrypted file will be saved in the same folder. With a .RYaes128 file extension.

tip: for password protecting multiple files together, first move all files in one folder and then zip them. now you can encrypt the single zipped file at once.
